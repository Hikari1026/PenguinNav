# PenguinNav
WPF Application that allows to control a ROV Rpi powered. Still a work in prgress

TO DO
- Gamepad extension
- Converting gamepad input to message
- Send to Rpi (even though I should still buy one)
- Read response correctly (only dummy data has been sent and recieved on test)
- Finish UI Elements (some stuff still missing)
